Mixing them can lead to the release of toxic gases or cause violent reactions.\n\n5. **Baking Soda and Vinegar**: While this combination is often used for cleaning, in enclosed spaces, it can produce carbon dioxide gas, which can lead to suffocation if not properly ventilated.\n\nAlways read labels, follow instructions, and never mix household cleaners unless the labels explicitly say it is safe to do so.
