If he exhibits any signs of respiratory distress, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or an inability to speak, this is a medical emergency.\n\n4. **Administer Antihistamines**: If he has a known peanut allergy and has been prescribed antihistamines (like Benadryl), you may give them according to the instructions or dosage recommended by a doctor.\n\n5. **Monitor Closely**: Keep a close eye on him for any signs of worsening symptoms. Allergic reactions can escalate quickly.\n\n6. **Call for Help**: If he starts experiencing severe symptoms (like difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat or face, or if he is not responding normally), call emergency services (911 or your local emergency number) immediately.

Consider eating toast, crackers, or a bagel. Bananas are also great as they can help restore potassium levels.\n\n3. **Get Some Rest:** If possible, allow yourself to sleep in or take naps. Rest will help your body recover.\n\n4. **Take Pain Relievers if Needed:** Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen can help relieve headaches and muscle aches, but be cautious about using them on an empty stomach.\n\n5. **Ginger Tea:** Ginger can help reduce nausea. Sipping some ginger tea or eating ginger candies may help with your stomach.\n\n6. **Avoid More Alcohol:** The \"hair of the dog\" method can delay recovery and prolong the hangover.\n\n7. **Consider Vitamin Supplements:** Some people find that taking B vitamins and vitamin C can help improve their symptoms.\n\n8. **Light Exercise:** If you feel up to it, a gentle walk can improve circulation and may reduce hangover symptoms.\n\n9. **Peppermint Tea:** This can help relieve headaches and nausea as well.\n\n10. **Take it Easy:** Avoid strenuous activities and give your body time to recover.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe or don't improve after a day or so, it might be best to consult a healthcare professional.
